    <p>
      This project is a <strong>Netflix-inspired web application</strong> built using 
      <strong>Django and Bootstrap</strong>. It features a dynamic homepage with a movie 
      carousel and responsive cards displaying trending films. Each movie card links 
      directly to the official YouTube trailer for instant viewing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The website also includes a fully functional <strong>Contact Page</strong> where 
      users can submit their name, email, phone number, and message. All form data 
      is validated before submission and securely stored in the Django Admin portal, 
      where it can be viewed, updated, or deleted by the admin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The design includes a <strong>custom navigation bar</strong> and consistent 
      page structure using Djangoâ€™s template inheritance. This project demonstrates 
      my ability to build both frontend and backend features while following 
      clean coding and user experience principles.
